    <p>Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites and web applications, encompassing everything from the initial design and coding to the ongoing functionality and performance. It involves various tasks, including front-end development (the user-facing part), back-end development (the server-side logic), and full-stack development (combining both). Web developers use coding languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with various tools and frameworks, to create websites and web applications that are functional, user-friendly, and accessible to users. </p>
